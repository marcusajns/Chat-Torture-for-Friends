Hello Friends!
I will help you with writing the code for Chat Torture.
You can play it in either Singleplayer or Multiplayer.
Just be patient with it as it does take some time.
Let's have some fun, shall we?

I am writing code messages and titles 
relative to my sayings or Vinic's sayings, so
change it to how you like.
